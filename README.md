# Jarvisvoice
# Overview
This Voice Assistant Project is designed to create a virtual assistant capable of performing various tasks based on user input through voice commands. The assistant utilizes natural language processing (NLP) and speech recognition technologies to understand and respond to user queries.

# Features
Speech Recognition: The assistant can convert spoken language into text using a speech recognition API or library.
Natural Language Understanding (NLU): NLU techniques are employed to understand the user's intent and extract relevant information from their queries.
Task Automation: The assistant can automate tasks such as sending emails, setting reminders, providing weather forecasts, and more.
Voice Synthesis: It can generate synthesized speech output to communicate responses and information back to the user.
# Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language used for development.
SpeechRecognition: Python library for speech recognition.
NLTK: Natural Language Toolkit for NLP functionalities.
neuralintents: Optional integration for advanced natural language understanding and generation capabilities.
Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS): Python library to convert text to speech.
